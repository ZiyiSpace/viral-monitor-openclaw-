00:00:00,112 --> 00:00:03,488
Okay folks, things are moving so fast.

2
00:00:03,824 --> 00:00:09,248
This is open claw meets 3D printing. So we got the kids a bamboo.

3
00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:15,584
machine for Christmas. I mean, it's for the whole family and I use it a ton. But in spirit, it was like for the kids.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,600
like for education for you know learning about like 3d printing so uh we've

5
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:25,568
so many prints but from the bamboo marketplace which has a lot of options

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,159
I saw recently, though, that the new Gemini DeepThink model, I think 3, can generate STL 5.

7
00:00:32,176 --> 00:00:38,176
So I got an API key for that and gave it to one of my open clause that I'm making more technical.

8
00:00:38,192 --> 00:00:44,192
Cole. So Cole, who is an open claw, I wanted him to control the machine and this print

9
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:50,208
is finally being sent to the machine by Cole instead of me, okay? So this is Cole controlling the machine.

10
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:54,240
And I have Cole generating his own STL files.

11
00:00:54,688 --> 00:01:00,688
And my goal here is that Cole can then communicate with my open claw who manages my homeschool.

12
00:01:00,704 --> 00:01:06,704
curriculum and see all of the lessons I have planned for like the next week or so and choose to print

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,720
something in the 3d world that's useful to that lesson so let's say well this week for instance

14
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:18,736
for science we're teaching um like the bones and muscles how muscles pull on bones and joints so

15
00:01:18,752 --> 00:01:24,752
So I'm going like, so what if, and I just need to figure out if Cole can actually generate like how good his STL files from Germany can.

16
00:01:24,768 --> 00:01:30,768
gemini can be because this is more of like a simple thing but if coal can generate like an example of a

17
00:01:30,784 --> 00:01:36,784
like two bones connected, then he could actually print a model for the kids that I pull out.

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,800
and use for that lesson. So that's where I'm trying to go like a next level, like bringing some of these things.

19
00:01:42,816 --> 00:01:48,816
into the real world giving my open clause like real world clause so we'll see how it goes

20
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:56,688
I've proven that Cole at OpenClaw can use the machine, but can he generate brilliant files? Time will tell.
